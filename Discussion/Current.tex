\subsection{Current}
\label{sec:discussion_current}

\subsubsection{Reflection}
Thinking back, we should have included a better external ADC. With the 400 mV/A, it is very difficult to measure very small currents. Thus, like the other functions of the multimeter, an auto-range mode would have been optimal, so it would be possible to shift between measuring small and larger currents.
\subsubsection{Future improvements}
While it is possible to measure negative currents, our code as it is does not allow for that. This could be implemented given more time. 
With a hall sensor as the measuring device, it is very susceptible to EM-noise and interference. This can be countered by shielding it with a metal casing.

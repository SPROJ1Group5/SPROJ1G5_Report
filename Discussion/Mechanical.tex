\subsubsection{Reflection}
We had great discussions about the appearance of our product. It is important to get the appearance right since this is a first-hand impression, which is a noteworthy attribute. All in all, we are very satisfied with the result of the looks and functionality. We were a little concerned with the way we attached the top part of the enclosure to the bottom part, in terms of stability. But we were pleasantly surprised by the firmness of the method. The lid for the battery took a few iterations to get the connection and disconnection right, but we got it right in the end.
\subsubsection{Future improvements}
We wanted some tactile buttons that had the push-part already extended, resulting in that we would not have had to resort to glueing the guides to our short buttons. This way, we would be more confident when taking the enclosure apart, since these guides needs to fit in the list when placing the top part down. Otherwise, we can not really think of how we would have approached this any other way, since it came out this nice.

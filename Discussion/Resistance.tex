\subsection{Resistance}
\label{sec:discussion_resistance}

\subsubsection{Reflection}
The way we approached this problem, was to choose five values for our reference. These values jump in value a lot, thus making some resistance domains very uncertain. But, with a better external ADC, we would be able to measure these domains more precisely, without including more values. However, we were limited by the GPIO-pins of the Nano and the only way to get around this, would have been to include some external GPIO extender, that can control more MOSFETs connecting reference resistance to the analog-pin.

\subsubsection{Future improvements}
For further refinement of the feature, both an external GPIO extender paired with an external ADC would improve accuracy greatly. Due to semiconductors being susceptible to temperature change, some sort of chamber where temperature can be controlled can also increase the consistency.

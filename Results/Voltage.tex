\subsection{Voltage}
\label{sec:results_voltage}

These are our results when measuring voltage with our multimeter. The tests were performed with a power supply sweeping the voltage from 0 to 20V. While this was happening the voltage was measured by our multimeter and a calibrated one. The test has been performed with the use of Keysight 34461A Digital Multimeters which is referred to as Calibrated.

Figure \ref{fig:ResVoltageDelta} shows the difference between our multimeter measurement and the measurement of the calibrated one as well as the set point on the power supply. See Figure \ref{fig:VM1} for test setup.

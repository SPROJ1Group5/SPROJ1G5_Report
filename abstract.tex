\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}
This report details the collaborative efforts of our group in designing and constructing a multimeter capable of measuring voltage, current, frequency, resistance, continuity, and temperature. Our work involved different aspects, like research, prototyping, circuit planning, coding, and addressing challenges that arose during the development process. In the end, we came up with a device that fulfills the requirements.

\subsection{Requirements}
This project aims to create a multimeter with the following requirements: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Voltmeter with a range of 0 - 20V.
    \item Resistance meter.
    \item Two or more additional electrical quantities.
    \item Show measurements with correct units on the display.
    \item The final prototype should be a fully usable tool without any dangling wires and such.
    \item It should have a case and be portable.
    \item The user should be able to use a menu to select between functions.
    \item The main microcontroller should be protected so that it doesn't break during operation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Work Distribution}
The device is a result of the whole team working together. We decided to split the requirements into smaller, more manageable subsystems and assign a person to each one of them.
